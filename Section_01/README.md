🐍 Section 1: Python Fundamentals (Days 1-10)

Author: Healy Patel
Course: 100 Days of Code: The Complete Python Pro Bootcamp (Angela Yu, Udemy)
Status: Completed ✅

📖 Overview

The first 10 days focus on the foundations of Python, moving from simple scripts to more complex logic using loops, functions, and dictionaries.
By Day 10, the focus is on procedural programming, writing code that executes in clear, logical steps.
