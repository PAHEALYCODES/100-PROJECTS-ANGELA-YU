# 🐍 Section 1: Python Fundamentals (Days 1-10)

**Author:** Healy Patel
**Course:** 100 Days of Code: The Complete Python Pro Bootcamp
**Status:** Completed ✅

## 📖 Overview
The first 10 days focus on the building blocks of Python. The goal is to move from simple printing scripts to complex logic involving loops, functions, and dictionaries. By Day 10, the focus shifts to "Procedural Programming"—writing code that executes in logical, step-by-step procedures.

## 📂 Project Details

### 🎸 Day 1: Band Name Generator
* **Description:** A simple script that asks for the user's city and pet name, then combines them to create a band name.
* **Key Concepts:**
    * `print()` vs `input()`
    * String Concatenation (`"str" + "str"`)
    * Variables
* **What I Learned:** How to capture user input and manipulate strings.

### 💸 Day 2: Tip Calculator
* **Description:** A program that calculates how much each person needs to pay when splitting a bill, including a specific tip percentage.
* **Key Concepts:**
    * Data Types (String, Integer, Float, Boolean)
    * Type Conversion (`int()`, `str()`)
    * f-Strings for formatting (`f"Total: {score}"`)
    * Mathematical Operations
* **What I Learned:** How to handle data types correctly (avoiding TypeErrors) and round numbers to 2 decimal places.

### 🏴‍☠️ Day 3: Treasure Island
* **Description:** A text-based adventure game where the user makes choices (Left/Right, Swim/Wait) to find the treasure.
* **Key Concepts:**
    * Control Flow (`if`, `elif`, `else`)
    * Comparison Operators (`>`, `<`, `==`)
    * Logical Operators (`and`, `or`, `not`)
* **What I Learned:** How to nest `if` statements to create complex decision trees.

### ✂️ Day 4: Rock Paper Scissors
* **Description:** A game where you play Rock, Paper, Scissors against the computer.
* **Key Concepts:**
    * Randomization (`import random`)
    * Python Lists (`my_list = []`)
    * Index Errors (Off-by-one errors)
* **What I Learned:** How to access specific items in a list using an index (e.g., `list[0]`) and handle nested lists.

### 🔐 Day 5: Password Generator
* **Description:** A tool that generates a secure, randomized password containing letters, numbers, and symbols.
* **Key Concepts:**
    * `for` loops
    * `range()` function
    * Accumulating data inside a loop
    * `random.choice()` vs `random.shuffle()`
* **What I Learned:** How to iterate through data to build a result step-by-step.

### 🤖 Day 6: Escaping the Maze
* **Description:** Algorithms to guide a robot through a maze (using Reeborg's World).
* **Key Concepts:**
    * Defining Functions (`def my_function():`)
    * `while` loops
    * Indentation & Code Blocks
* **What I Learned:** The difference between `for` loops (definite iteration) and `while` loops (indefinite iteration).

### 😵 Day 7: Hangman
* **Description:** The classic word-guessing game. The user has 6 lives to guess a random word.
* **Key Concepts:**
    * Flowcharting logic
    * Checking if a list contains an item (`if letter in word:`)
    * Replacing items in a list (replacing `_` with the correct letter)
* **What I Learned:** How to break a complex problem into 5 small "ToDo" steps and solve them one by one.

### 🏛️ Day 8: Caesar Cipher
* **Description:** An encryption tool that shifts letters in a message by a set number (e.g., A -> C).
* **Key Concepts:**
    * Functions with Inputs (Parameters vs Arguments)
    * Positional vs Keyword Arguments
    * Modulus operator `%` (to wrap around the alphabet)
* **What I Learned:** How to create reusable blocks of code that can accept external data.

### 🔨 Day 9: Secret Auction
* **Description:** A program that accepts anonymous bids and reveals the highest bidder at the end.
* **Key Concepts:**
    * Python Dictionaries (`{key: value}`)
    * Nesting Lists and Dictionaries
    * Looping through a dictionary
* **What I Learned:** Dictionaries are essential for grouping related data (like a user's name *and* their bid).

### 🧮 Day 10: Calculator App
* **Description:** A text-based calculator that supports addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. It allows "chaining" calculations (using the previous answer).
* **Key Concepts:**
    * Functions with Outputs (`return`)
    * Docstrings
    * Recursion (Calling a function inside itself)
    * `while` loops flags
* **What I Learned:** The `return` keyword is how functions pass data back to the rest of the program.
